##Â Create Configuration

We start of by creating the configuration file. Create a folder called .circleci.

Add the following content to the config.yml 
```
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker: 
      - image: circleci/node:4.8.2 # the primary container, where your job's commands are run
   steps:
      - checkout # check out the code in the project directory
      - run: echo "hello world" # run the echo command
```
In this case, we have done it for you when you pulled down the repository. You can check if the config.yml contains the correct information using.

`cat config.yml`{{execute}}
remember to go back to the foo_ci folder
`cd ..`{{execute}}

## Validate and test it works

`circleci config validate`{{execute}}


`circleci local execute`{{execute}}
