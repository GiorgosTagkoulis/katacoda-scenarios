CircleCi is a Continuous Integrations (CI) tool that empowers software engineering teams to be more productive through intelligent automation. 

CircleCI integrates with many Version Control Systems (VCS) like GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket and every time a developer commits his code, CircleCI creates a pipeline and automatically runs it in a clean container, allowing the developer to test every commit. It is possible the whole team to be notified through CircleCi's slack integration, leading to quick fixes and faster deployment time.

In this tutorial, the focus is on how to install the command line interface (CLI) of CircleCI locally in your systems, set it up, validate your configuration and test a job before pushing it to a VCS.

In every step, there is a text snippet hidden in various places. If all these snippets are clicked, in the order of the steps, at the final step a reward will be revealed.
