So far, we have achieved to install successfully the CircleCi CLI tool, and initialize manually a demo project with a basic CircleCI configuration. One of the advantages of the CLI tool, is that you validate the config file directly through your terminal, instead of pushing unnecessary commits to check the web app if the config is validated. 

For the demo project we have created, run the following command and make sure that the `config.yml`{{action}} is validated.

`circleci config validate`{{execute}}

## Run 

`circleci local execute`{{execute}}
