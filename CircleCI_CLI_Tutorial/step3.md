##Â Create Configuration

We start of by creating the configuration file.

Tip: Make sure you are in the foo_ci folder, can be done with the command
`cd ~/foo_ci`{{execute}}

Then create directory called .circleci
`mkdir .circleci`{{execute}}

Then change file to the new directory
`cd .circleci`{{execute}}

And last create config.yml
`touch config.yml`{{execute}}

Add the following content to the config.yml 
```
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    docker: 
      - image: circleci/node:4.8.2 # the primary container, where your job's commands are run
   steps:
      - checkout # check out the code in the project directory
      - run: echo "hello world" # run the echo command
```
In this case, we have done it for you when you pulled down the repository. You can check if the config.yml contains the correct information using
`cat config.yml`{{execute}}
remember to go back to the foo_ci folder
`cd ..`{{execute}}

## Validate and test it works

`circleci config validate`{{execute}}


`circleci local execute`{{execute}}
